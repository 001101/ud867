/* You may often come across situations where there's a part of your build
script that you'll want to change somewhat regularly. While you're well on your
way to being a build master, the other developers using your build might not be
so familiar with Gradle. This is especially true if you expect an automated
system to be running your build.

Gradle allows you to parametrize your build by adding properties to the project
object from outside your build script. There are three ways to do this, command
line arguments, a properties.gradle file, and environment variables.

Let's create a task





task bundleWeb(type: Zip) {
    baseName = 'web'
    destinationDir = file(webOutputDir)

    from 'src/web'
}
