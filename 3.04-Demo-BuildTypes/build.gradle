/*

The Android plugin allows for defining different versions of your
application that will be built. Instead of managing completely separate
code bases for each version of our app, we simply describe the differences
between them and Gradle and the Android plugin take care of the rest. We
call these different versions of our app, variants.

A build variant is comprised of a combination of product flavors and build
types. We'll talk about product flavors later in this lesson. Built types
are used to control how our app is built and packaged. By default, every
app has two build types, debug and release. As the names imply, the debug
build type is primarily used during development, and the release build type
is for production. Also, by default, the debug build type is compiled with
debug symbols and signed with a debug key, allowing it to be installed on
development devices. Build types are defined in the `buildTypes { }` script
block. Here we can see that Android Studio has already added some additional
configuration to the release build type for us. Take note, although debug
isn't listed here, the debug build type still exists. In this case we are
disabling packaging optimizations by setting 'minifyEnabled' to false. Also
we are configuring where the Android plugin should look for proguard
configuration.

android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'),
                    'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}

/*

If we look at the available tasks for our project, you'll see that build tasks
for each build type. This is how we tell Gradle which variant to build, by
either running the 'assembleDebug' or 'assembleRelease' tasks based on whether
we want the debug or release build type, respectively.

In addition to the existing debug and release build types, we can easily
create new ones by simply adding them to the `buildTypes { }` script block.
Let's say we wanted to build type specifically used by QA testers.
