/*
 * In this simple Gradle build script we have defined a single task named
 * "hello". As you can see, the task's action simply prints the string 
 * "Hello World" to the standard out.
 *
 * Since we haven't installed Gradle yet, we'll execute this task using the
 * Gradle wrapper. The wrapper is a script that will download and install
 * a specified version of Gradle.
 *
 * Challenges:
 *   1. Use the Gradle wrapper to execute the task "hello".
 *   2. Modify the action of this task so it instead prints your name.
 *
 * Remember that you can always look at the solution.gradle file for guidance!
