/*
 * In this series of exercises you'll be exploring how Gradle handles various
 * logging outputs during the build process. We'll look at how to add logging
 * statements to your build as well as how to use the various command line
 * otions to adjust the amount of logging output we recieve.
 *
 * Exercises:
 *
 * 1. Add logging statements at the beginning and end of the task action for
 *    the HelloTask at the INFO level.
 * 2. Execute the "hello" task with the appropriate command line options such
 *    that our newly added logging statements are shown in the console output.
 * 3. Modify the `println()` call in our task action to instead by a logging
 *    statement at the LIFECYCLE level.
 * 4. Execute the "hello" task and confirm the output.
 * 5. Execute the "hello" task with the apporpriate command line options such
 *    that the text "Hello World" is no longer written to the console output.
