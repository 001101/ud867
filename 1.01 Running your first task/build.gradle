/*
    In this simple Gradle build script we have defined a single task named "hello".
    As you can see, the task's action simply prints the string "Hello World" to 
    standard out.

    Exercises:

    1. Using the Gradle Wrapper to execute the task "hello".
    2. Modify the action of this task so it instead prints your name.

task hello {
    doLast {
        println "Hello World"
    }
