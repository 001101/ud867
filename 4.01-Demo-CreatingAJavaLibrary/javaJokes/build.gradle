/*

We're just making a standard Java project, following all the default
conventions. That means our build.gradle is all of one line:

*/

apply plugin:"java"

/*

We can now create our joke telling library. We'll create a file at

javaJokes/src/main/java/com/udacity/gradle/jokes/Joker.java

With contents:

package com.udacity.gradle.jokes;

public class Joker {
    public String getJoke(){
        return "This is totally a funny joke";
    }
}

Now if we want to, we can navigate to the javaJokes directory and run Gradle
tasks like usual. However, our app project doesn't yet know anything about our
library. What we really need to do is declare a compile dependency on the
output of this project. To do that, we need to add this Gradle project to the
same multi-project build as the app. Let's head over to the settings.gradle
file in the project root.
