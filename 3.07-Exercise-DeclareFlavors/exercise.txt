In this series of exercises we'll be experimenting with Android product flavors.
Flavors are similar to build types, in that they are dimention of a build
variant. In this exercise you'll be implementing one of the most common product
flavor use cases, free and premium app variants. You'll be asked to create two
new product flavors. Some additional resources are already provided for each
product flavor.

Exercises:

1. Import the project into Android Studio.
2. Build the project and deploy it onto a device (or emulator). Note the
   product flavor shown on the main activity.
3. Define two new product flavors, 'free' and 'paid'.
4. Use the 'Build Variants' window in Android Studio to select each new variant
   and build/deploy the application onto a device.
5. Confirm that the correct product flavor is shown on the main activity.
