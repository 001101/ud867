/*
    In this series of exercises we will be working with the Java plugin and 
    some of the functionality it adds to our build. Specifically, we'l be using
    the Java plugin to package our compiled code into a JAR file. We've provided
    a simple project with a single class for you to practice with.

    Exercises:

    1. Apply the Java plugin to your project.
    2. Use the Gradle command-line to execute the appropariate task to build
       a JAR file.
