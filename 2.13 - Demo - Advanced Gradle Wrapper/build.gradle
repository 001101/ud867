/*
    We talked about the Gradle wrapper briefly at the beginning of the first
    lesson. The Gradle wrapper is comprised of a pair of scripts, a shell script
    for Unix and Mac operating systems, and a batch script for Windows. These 
    execute your build via a wrapper that will automatically download Gradle if
    it hasn't done so already. Essentially, the wrapper allows developers to
    use Gradle to build your project without have to actually download and 
    install Gradle itself.

    The Gradle wrapper can be initialized by running the 'wrapper' task. The
    'wrapper' task is available on every Gradle project. This task will set up
    the wrapper by generating the wrapper scripts as well as adding the wrapper
    jar and properties files to your project. The wrapper scripts are placed in
    the root of your project directory and the other files in the 
    'gradle/wrapper' directory.

    We can now run our Gradle build by using the wrapper scripts. We use the 
    scripts identically to how we would the 'gradle' command. 

        $ ./gradlew tasks
