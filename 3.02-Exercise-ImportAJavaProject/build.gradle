/*
    In this series of exercises we will be working with the Java plugin and
    some of the functionality it adds to our build. Specifically, we'l be using
    the Java plugin to package our compiled code into a JAR file. We've provided
    a simple project with a single class for you to practice with.

    Exercises:

    1. Apply the Java plugin to your project.
    2. Use the Gradle command-line to execute the appropriate task to build
       a JAR file.


It's difficult to get Android studio to use the solution.gradle file, so to run our solution, you can either run from the command line with the -b flag, or uncomment the following line to essentially paste the contents of the solution file into this one.
