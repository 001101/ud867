/*  Once you've installed Gradle, you no longer need to use the wrapper script,
and you can simply use the `gradle` command. */

/* This would be a great time to get the
Gradle Daemon set up. Gradle takes a while to start up each time, mostly because
it needs to spin up an instance of the JVM. The daemon will hang around in the
background keeping the JVM alive, making future Gradle invocations faster. On
Mac/Linux, you can configure Gradle to use daemon using the following line:

echo "org.gradle.daemon = True" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
