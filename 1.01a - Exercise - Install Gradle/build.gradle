Whenever we're working with an existing Gradle project, we'll be using the wrapper, because that way we can ensure that everyone working on the project is using the same version of Gradle.

If you want to create a new Gradle build, however, you'll need a local installation of Gradle. These instructions assume you have the Java Development Kit. If not (you can check by running `java -version`), skip below to the Java installation instructions.

There are a bunch of ways to install Gradle. If you're on Mac and use Homebrew (and if you don't you really should), you can install Gradle with a simple `brew install gradle`. Another option for Mac and Linux is to head over to http://gvmtool.net/ and install the Groovy Environment Manager, and use that to install Gradle. If neither of those options appeals to you, we'll go through the manual installation process for both Windows and Mac.

To install Gradle manually, we need to do three things. First we need to download Gradle. Next we need to put it where we want it on our machine. And finally we need to let the system know where to find it. We'll do the Mac. instructions first. Skip below for the Windows instructions

Mac instructions:

First, head over to https://gradle.org/downloads/, and download the latest version of Gradle. Next, we'll unzip Gradle and move it to where we want it to live. Our recommendation is in `/usr/local/gradle`. Then we need to add some lines to the /.bash_profile file to tell the system where to find our new installation of Gradle. You can do all these steps manually, but the easiest way is to paste the whole big block of instructions below into your terminal. Note that you may need to change the version number on the first and third lines.

unzip ~/Downloads/gradle-2.3-all.zip -d /usr/local/gradle/ &&\
echo '# Adding Gradle to system path
export GRADLE_HOME=/usr/local/gradle/gradle-2.3
PATH=$GRADLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
export PATH
# Turning on the Gradle daemon by default
export GRADLE_OPTS="-Dorg.gradle.daemon=true"' >> ~/.bash_profile &&\
source ~/.bash_profile

Windows instruction:






Once you've installed Gradle, you no longer need to use the wrapper script,
and you can simply use the `gradle` command. To see if Gradle was installed successfully, try running `gradle --version`.

Try using `gradle helloWorld` to run the task below using your new local installation.
*/

task << helloWorld {
    println "Hello, World!"
}

************ Java Installation Instructions **********

These instructions will explain how to get the Java Development Kit set up on your machine. There are three phases. First we need to download the JDK, then we need to move the downloaded files to where we want them to live, and finally we need to tell the system where to

Before following these instructions, check to make sure you haven't already installed Java by running `java -version`. If the output is something like the following:

    java version "1.8.0_40"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_40-b27)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.40-b25, mixed mode)

then you're already good to go!

*********** Mac Instructions *********

To download the JDK, visit

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Click on the JDK Download button, click on the radio button to accept the license agreement, and download the Mac OS X x64 package. At the time of this writing the most recent package was: jdk-8u40-macosx-x64.dmg

To tell OS X where to find java, we need to set a couple environment variables. The easiest way to do this is to run the following at the terminal:

echo "# Java environment variables
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
export JDK_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
" >> ~/.bash_profile&&\
source ~/.bash_profile

Now you're done! You can now test your Java installation by running `java -version`.

Awesome work! You can now complete your Gradle installation!

*********** Windows Instructions *********

To download the JDK, visit:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Click on the JDK Download button, click on the radio button to accept the license agreement, and download the Windows x64 package. At the time this was written, the most recent package was: jdk-8u40-windows-x64.exe

Run the installer, installing to the default location. At the time of this writing that was: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_40\

To tell Windows where to find Java, we need to add an environment variable. Navigate to the Control Panel > System > Advanced system settings > Advanced > Environment Variables... > System variables > New...

The variable name should be : JAVA_HOME

The variable value should be your install location. At the time of this writing it should be: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_40

You can now test your Java installation by running `java -version`.

Awesome work! You can now complete your Gradle installation!
