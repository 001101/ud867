/* In this simple Gradle build script we have defined a single task named
"hello". As you can see, the task's action simply prints the string "Hello
World" to the standard out.

Since we haven't installed Gradle yet, we'll execute this task using the Gradle
wrapper. The wrapper is a script that will download and install a specified
version of Gradle.

    Challenges:
    1. Use the Gradle wrapper to execute the task "hello".
    2. Modify the action of this task so it instead prints your name.

Remember that you can always look at the solution.gradle file for guidance!

// TODO: Use the Gradle wrapper to execute the task "hello"
// HINT: Go check out the solution.gradle file!

task hello {
    description "Hey student! Run this one :D"
    group "Our demo"
    doLast {
    // TODO: Modify this line to print your name, then run this task again
        println "Hello World!"
    }
}



/*  If you want to get ahead of the curve, this would be a great time to get the
Gradle Daemon set up. Gradle takes a while to start up each time, mostly because
it needs to spin up an instance of the JVM. The daemon will hang around in the
background keeping the JVM alive, making future Gradle invocations faster. On
Mac/Linux, you can configure Gradle to use daemon using the following line:

echo "org.gradle.daemon = True" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
