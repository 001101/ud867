/*

In this series of exercises we'll be adding variant specific capabilities. You
will be required to add an additional activity to the 'paid' product flavor,
which will then only be available in the paid version of the application.

Exercises:

1. Import the project into Android Studio.
2. Build the project and deploy it onto a device (or emulator).
3. Add a new activity to the paid flavor.
4. Add a button to the fragment 'FlavorFragment' in the paid favor which
   launches you new activity.
5. Build and deploy both flavors of you app again to confirm that the new
   activity is only in the paid app variant.

If you need help, take a look at the solution project located in the 'solution'
folder.
