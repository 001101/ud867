In this series of exercises we'll be adding variant specific capabilities. You
will be required to add an additional activity to the 'paid' product flavor,
which will then only be available in the paid version of the application.

Exercises:

1. Import the project into Android Studio.
2. Build the project and deploy it onto a device (or emulator).

If you need help, take a look at the solution project located in the 'solution' 
folder.
